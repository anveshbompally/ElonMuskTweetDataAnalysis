# ElonMuskTweetDataAnalysis
The objective of this project is to perform keyword network analysis and word frequency analysis using R


The data folder provides the twitter data of Elon Musk from 2010-2021. For analysis purposes I have considered
the years 2017-2021. Each year has thousands of tweets. 
1. Computed word frequencies for each year. Excluding the most common english stop words.
2. Showed the top 10 words (for each year) by the highest value of word frequency
3. Plotted histogram of word frequencies for each year
4. Used Zipfâ€™s law and plot log-log plots of word frequencies and rank for each year
5. Created a bigram network graph for each year
